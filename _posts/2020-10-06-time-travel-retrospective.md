## Ice Breaker - Time Travel back to 1900

> You find a time travel machine and accidentally end up back in 1900. 
You meet your grand-grand-grand parents.  
<br/>How would you describe your current job to them? 

## Retrospective format

> You've finally understood how the time machine works.
Now you decide to go back 2 weeks ago and repeat the sprint.

**What would you keep doing the same?**

This section allows participants to think about what they did well during
the last sprint and would keep doing in similar situations.  

**What would you do differently?**

Here the participants have the chance to learn from their past actions and
say what they would change if they found themselves in a sprint similar to
their last one.


Based on the ideas gathers from the team, the retrospective continues with the
classical structure:
- facilitator goes over each idea by reading it out loud and groups them
- each participant vote the n most preferred ideas
- facilitator moderates discussion about the most voted ideas and find retro actions together with the team 

## Closure - One advice for future you

> Even if we can use the time travel machine, we still cannot change how things happened. 
However, we can still learn from the experience.  
<br/>You have the possibility of leaving a secret note in case a future you decide to come back to this exact moment.  
<br/>What piece of advice you would give to yourself after this sprint?
