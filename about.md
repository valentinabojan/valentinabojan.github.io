Hey there! ^._.^

My name is Valentina and I am a cat lover and movie passionate. But this is not what my blog is about. 

Bit by bit, I will fill this jar with (solved) challenges that I face every day while trying to write software, applying DevOps practices or being Agile.  

Have I already drawn your attention? Then stay tuned! 🐱‍💻 

Thanks for reading!
