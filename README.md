## The Jar of Bits blog


GitHub Pages and Jekyll were the choice to be the foundation of this blog,
but there were a lot of bit and pieces that polished it:
* configure my contact list
* add reading time
* create drafts for my posts before publishing them
* add post excerpts in the Home page
* change the post date format
* monitor the website traffic with Google Analytics
* enable Disqus comments
* display number of comments
* add tags
* enjoy the new blog üç∫
